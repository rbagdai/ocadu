        <h3> Here's my Reading Response to Laurel Schwulst's "<a href="https://thecreativeindependent.com/people/laurel-schwulst-my-website-is-a-shifting-house-next-to-a-river-of-knowledge-what-could-yours-be/">My website is a shifting house next to a river of knowledge</a>" article.</h3>

            <li><strong>Why does Laurel Schwulst (Links to an external site.) advocate for individual websites over social media? Do you agree with her? Please explain your answer.</strong>
            </br>
              In her article, Schwulst advocates for individual websites over social media. Her advocacy leans towards the individual, for they  do not specifically have capitalistic goals. Furthermore, individual websites open doors to individual creative freedom, expression, and representation one’s individualistic dekko and content. Whereas, corporate social media platforms such as Facebook and Instagram have capitalistic end-goals, such as, to profit from user activity. Apart from that, they also observe altruistic behaviour (diminishing originality), and underscored by divides in several sociopolitical conflicts on these major platforms. Just like any argument, I intend to partially agree. The capitalist goals and altruistic behaviours do lead to diminished individuality on social media platforms, not to mention, the alarming amount of personal data these sites can gather. On the other hand, having a personalized individual website to represent my views and expressions with freedom of my own is impressive, and enables more creativity compared to the restrictive creative tools provided by social media giants. However, it is hard to get discovered with an Individual website. Social media platforms also have great strengths of users, algorithms and tools that make content discovery easier.

            <li><strong>In this article, Schwulst outlines several metaphors defining the behaviour of websites. Write a paragraph describing your own metaphor for a website. Put that text into its own simple website designed to extend that comparison. Upload it to your github server and post the link.</strong>

            A website, through my lenses, is like origami – a piece of paper folded multiple times, turned into a beautiful shape. It is a symbol of quintessential skills and techniques, efforts and time, that result in an impressive outcome. With every layer of fold unraveled, there’s a different narrative conveyed, different layers of significance shared.
