        <h3> Here's my Reading Response to Olia Lialina's "<a href="http://contemporary-home-computing.org/turing-complete-user/">Turing Complete User</a>" article.</h3>
        <ol>
            <li><strong>What do you think is Lialina's opinion of the word "user"?</strong>
            </br>
              Lialina discusses how authoritative views from recognized figures were phasing out the word "user", and how calling "users" as "people" is a gentle reminder to designers, in the bounds of Interface Design, that users who use the system are humans. Whilst discussing relevant reasonings, she also believes the word "users" also plays a vital role, and using "people" instead of it, could rather be "dangerous". She argues that the term "users". references towards the system one uses, and serves as a reminder that the person is operating a "computer" or a "programmed system". Furthermore, she also argues that developers/designers are a separate entity from the users, while the program is developed by the designer/developer, the "bloggers, artists, podcasters" can be considered as the users. Therefore, if this distinction is removed, users might lose control and rights over their usage of a certain program, and even the computer itself.

            <li><strong>What is Lialina's ideal internet user? Provide some of the qualities that she outlines.</strong>
            </br>
              Lialina's idea of the ideal internet user is described by either of these terms she utilizes: "Universal User" "General Purpose User" or the "Turing Complete User". She argues that a user should be able to accomplish their desired task regardless of a program being developed in a non-complyinh way. Basically, a user should be able to achieve their desired task with enough experience, time and learning, be it on a program that is specialized. It can be compared to the idea of Turing test for AI. An example of this could be the use of social media as an outlet for sharing photos, opinions, thought provoking discussions, and at the same time, businesses, ads, and more.

          </br>
            <li><strong>From your own experiences interacting on the webâ€”what is an example where there are "gaps that can be filled by users"?</strong>
            </br>
            "Gaps" on the internet exist everywhere and are a vital way to build interaction amongst the user and the program. Ranging from the Subject and Body Text in emails, Contacts and Message section in messaging apps, Status update boxes on social media networks, the Image editing options on instagram etc. They require "users" to input a certain command, to fill out the "gap" in the code, to carry out a certain function. A program or a website already knows what to do, given that the developer has already developed the code behind it, however, it requires input from "users" in areas known as "gaps" or fields, that carry the information that the users input, for the program or the website to process.
