        <h3> Here's my Reading Response to Mindy Seu's "<a href="https://www.are.na/blog/the-poetry-of-tools">The Poetry of Tools</a>" article.</h3>
        <ol>
            <li><strong>In the opening paragraph of her post, Seu asks you, the reader to join her to 'defamiliarize our tools.' What do you think she means by that? And how do you think that action relates to her use of the word poetry?</strong>
            </br>
              Sue opens the article with the statement “defamiliarize our tools”. With this, she intends to bid her audience to ponder upon and fathom their interaction with technological tools they use. Interacting with technology has become easier, and to some, a second nature; making their interaction, more often than not, unintelligible. That’s were her concern manifests, analogized as poetry, asserting how we should use and perceive our interaction with technology and tools differently. Her aim is to help us understand how technology and tools are not supposed to be taken for granted, rather appreciated and used consciously, like one would delicately treat a poem.

            <li><strong>Seu outlines 6 categories within her taxonomy of tool poetics (Slow Growth & Slow Death, Early Works, Performing Data, Removing Function from Form, Production of Errors, & Regeneration). Choose at least one of these categories and define it in your own words. Now find a website or online interface* not mentioned in her post that you feel operates within the chosen definition. Explain why.</strong>
            </br>
            One of her tool poetics is “early works”. Sue divulges upon how early computers (or human-computer interaction) came with major curbs and limitations, albeit computer artists used them aptly, engendering poetic forms greatly influenced by these constraints. Myron Krueger’s “VideoSpace” is a prominent example of Early Works. He explored Virtual Reality in the early days, wherein computer simulations arrayed individuals as motion-silhouettes, that enabled crude actions as they interacted with objects on the screen. The limitations were the inability to replicate the exact human form, inadequate processing power and technological tools, however, they resulted in a poetic interactive form, although crude, but still a piece of art that should be appreciated and used consciously.

            <a href="https://www.spacejam.com/" target="_blank">SpaceJam</a>, originally developed in 1996, demonstrates the manifestation of restrictive human-computer interaction. However, it is a piece of art, a repository of posters, screensavers, music clips etc. under various categories. Once the website is opened, it gives a sense of entering a totally new world, which in its day and age, would be really impressive for the audience interacting with the website itself. Although the graphics, code and everything else is very limited to what existed back then.
